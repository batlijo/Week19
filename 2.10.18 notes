variable placeholders

react is aware that these are variables and will dynamically update...foreshadowing.
import React from "react";

// The Math function component accepts a props argument
const Math = (props) => {
  let value;

  // Assign value based on the operator
  switch (props.operator) {
    case "+":
      value = props.num1 + props.num2;
      break;
    case "-":
      value = props.num1 - props.num2;
      break;
    case "*":
      value = props.num1 * props.num2;
      break;
    case "/":
      value = props.num1 / props.num2;
      break;
    default:
      value = NaN;
  }

  // Return a span element containing the calculated value
  // Set the fontSize to the value in pixels
  // Unlike a regular function, a component must always return a React element
  // Null or False are also acceptable return types which won't render anything
  return <span style={{ fontSize: value }}>{value}</span>;
};

other notes:
12- stu-props activity:

- reusability
- create a friend card component just 1 that takes in for different variables or different props
  - very dynamic
  - returns jsx wrapped by card that has an image and a name {props.image} and is rendered 4 times
- html should have been identical except for what...made it modular by making a resuable component...different pictures you give it. Components that are resuable
- array of data before it went into component would change. it's dynamic
- create dynamic components that change even though our html didn't change, aha!


13- stu-component-map
render li
we're mapping multiple li's inside of one big ul 
whenever we try to to render an array containing JSX react knows to render each JSX element seperately
using the filter method we can create a new array containing only groceries which havent been purchased
